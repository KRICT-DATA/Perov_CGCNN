1. For CGCNN searching when B-site is unary,
Type:
cd unary
python search.py

This will take some time and will create .log and .pkl files. .log files contain log of calculations and .pkl files contain the lowest-energy atomic configuration at each composition as a ASE atoms format.
"log_files" and "pickle_files" directories contain the .log and .pkl files created by the authors.

2. For CGCNN searching when B-site is binary,
Type:
cd binary 
python search.py

This will submit jobs to supercomputer cluster nodes. .log and .pkl files will be created.
"job_files", "log_files" and "pickle_files" directories contain the job*.sh, .log, and .pkl files created by the authors.
.pkl files contain the lowest-energy atomic configuration at each composition as a ASE atoms format.

3. For CGCNN searching when B-site is ternary,
Type:
cd ternary 
python search.py

This will submit jobs to supercomputer cluster nodes. .log and .pkl files will be created.
"job_files", "log_files" and "pickle_files" directories contain the job*.sh, .log, and .pkl files created by the authors.
.pkl files contain the lowest-energy atomic configuration at each composition as a ASE atoms format.

4. For CGCNN searching when B-site is quaternary,
Type:
cd quaternary 
python search.py

This will submit jobs to supercomputer cluster nodes. .log and .pkl files will be created.
"job_files", "log_files" and "pickle_files" directories contain the job*.sh, .log, and .pkl files created by the authors.
.pkl files contain the lowest-energy atomic configuration at each composition as a ASE atoms format.

5. To predict bandgap and band type for the lowest-energy configuration at each composition,
Type:
python get_data.py

This will create "All_data.csv" file containing decomposition enthalpy - T*dS, tau (Bartel's tolerance factor), band type, and bandgap for 41400 composition.

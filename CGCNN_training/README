1. Type "sh make_id_prop.sh [property]". Replace [property] to one of the properties: decomp, bandgap, and bandtype. This will create "id_prop.csv" file in "cif_dir" directory. "id_prop.csv" file contains values of the designated property for each CIF file. Check whether the "id_prop.csv" file was created, by typing "vi ./cif_dif/id_prop.csv"

2. Type "python main.py --epochs 100000 --train-ratio 0.7 --val-ratio 0.1 --test-ratio 0.2 ./cif_dir" to train regression model for decomp and bandgap. 
Type "python main.py --epochs 100000 --task classification --train-ratio 0.7 --val-ratio 0.1 --test-ratio 0.2 ./cif_dir" to train classification model for bandtype.
If you have computer cluster node, submit job to the cluster by typing "sbatch job_submit_example.sh", for example.
This will create "model_best.pth.tar" and "checkpoint.pth.tar" files. After sufficient epochs, use "model_best.pth.tar" as the final model.
